Title: Record Linkage Toolkit
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Jan van der Laan
Maintainer: Jan van der Laan <r@eoos.dds.nl>
Description: Functions to assist in performing probabilistic record linkage and
    deduplication: generating pairs, comparing records, em-algorithm for
    estimating m- and u-probabilities, forcing one-to-one matching. Can also be
    used for pre- and post-processing for machine learning methods for record
    linkage. Focus is on memory, CPU performance and flexibility.
