cluster
==============================================================

- [ ] `select_pairs` / `cluster_select_threshold`
- [ ] `cluster_collect` should accept a selection column and only return
  selected pairs.
- [ ] `compare_vars`
- [ ] a generic predict routine: pass it a model and it will call predict on
  each node and add the results to the pairs. This can be used in combination
  with other machine learning methods.
- [ ] `add_from_x` and `add_from_y`.
